# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Bobby is an up-and-coming HR analyst whose task is to perform employee research. Specifically, he needs to find answers to the following questions: Who will be retiring in the next few years? And how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package. The employee data Bobby needs is only available in the form of six CSV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data.

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results

-The first task is to create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. In order to accomplish this, we retrieved data from Employees/Titles tables. In doing so, we discover the majority of people born during those years who retired held the title of Staff followed by Senior Engineer.

-Second, we compiled a list of current employees eligible for a mentorship program. 
 
## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
